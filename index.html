                            brother of Tyrion Lannister. He was involved in an incestuous relationship with Cersei, and
                            unknown to most, he was the

                            Tyrion Lannister. She was
                            involved in an incestuous relationship with Jaime, who was secretly the father of her three

                            After narrowly escaping the persecution of House Stark by House Lannister, Arya is trained

                            return to Westeros, she exacts
                            retribution for the Red Wedding by exterminating the Frey male line.</p>
